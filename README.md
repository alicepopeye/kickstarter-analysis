# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We try to find out how the campaign outcom difference based onthe launched date and funding goal.

### Purpose
Compare outcome vs launched date, and outcome vs funding goal

## Analysis and Challenges
Learn new function: ifs

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May: May have the highest successful count; but May is also the highest fail month for the year.
Dec: There is 50% chances for a successful campaign and failed campaign in Dec. Dec has the lowest succeesful rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
100% fail if the funding goal is more than $44,999.
The highest successful campaign is when the goal is less than $1000, the next is less than $5000.
The success campaigna nd failed campaign is mirror of each other.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Learning some new functions

## Results
For highest successful campaign try to launch in May with goal less than $5000

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Most campaign launched in May will succeed. Summer (May-Aug) are good to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Do not have a funding goal over $44,999= 100% failed. There 50/50 if the funding goal is between $15,000 and $19,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The geographic is very large. We don't know how it do locally (by state, or by city)
We don't know what is the demographic of the backers.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A chart to show the lenth of the campaign vs outcome.
